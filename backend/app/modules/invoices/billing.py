"""The billing engine: turns due subscriptions into invoices.

How it works, in plain words:
  1. Find active subscriptions whose next_invoice_date is today or earlier.
  2. For each one, make an invoice for that period (lines, discount, tax, totals).
  3. Move next_invoice_date forward by the plan's billing period.
  4. Repeat until next_invoice_date is in the future, so missed days are caught up.

Running it twice can never double-bill: the database refuses a second invoice
for the same subscription and period_start.
