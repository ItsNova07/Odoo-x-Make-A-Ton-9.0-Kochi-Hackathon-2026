"""The one Brightloop backend: login (Member 2), catalog (Member 3) and billing (Member 4).

Two SQLite files, as Member 2 designed:
  member2.db    logins, customers, reset tokens, audit log   (app.core.database)
  hackathon.db  products, plans, subscriptions, invoices...  (app.db)
They are linked by username, never by joining the two databases.
